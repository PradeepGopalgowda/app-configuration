# Authenticating with service credentials
{: #ac-service-credentials}

You can generate a new set of credentials for cases where you want to manually connect an app or external consumer to an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service. Credentials are provided in JSON format. The JSON snippet lists credentials, such as the API key and secret, as well as connection information for the service.
