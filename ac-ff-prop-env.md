# Set up environments, feature flags, and properties
{: #ac-ff-prop-env}

Use feature flags to enable or disable a feature in your application code. You can also manage the properties for distributed applications centrally.
{: shortdesc}

## Environments
{: #ac-setup-environments}

Environments in {{site.data.keyword.appconfig_short}} represents your application environments. Typical environments could be dev, staging, production and so on. Environments allow to manage your feature flags and properties to various deployments from development to production. For more information, see [environments](/docs/app-configuration?topic=app-configuration-ac-environments).

## Feature flags
{: #ac-setup-ff}

Separate code delivery from feature enablement. Dark launch feature code in the application to a set of target users. For more information, see [feature flags](/docs/app-configuration?topic=app-configuration-ac-feature-flags).

## Properties
{: #ac-setup-prop}

Configure and manage properties for distributed applications and environments centrally in one place. For more information, see [properties](/docs/app-configuration?topic=app-configuration-ac-properties).
