# Set up environments, feature flags, and properties
{: #ac-ff-prop-env}

Use feature flags to enable or disable a feature in your application code. You can also manage the properties for distributed applications centrally.
{: shortdesc}

## Environments
{: #ac-setup-environments}

Environments in {{site.data.keyword.appconfig_short}} represent your application environments. Typical environments might be dev, staging, or production. Environments manage your feature flags and properties to various deployments from development to production. For more information, see [Environments](/docs/app-configuration?topic=app-configuration-ac-environments).

## Feature flags
{: #ac-setup-ff}

Separate code delivery from feature enablement. Dark launch feature code in the application to a set of target users. For more information, see [feature flags](/docs/app-configuration?topic=app-configuration-ac-feature-flags).

## Properties
{: #ac-setup-prop}

Configure and manage properties for distributed applications and environments centrally in one place. For more information, see [Properties](/docs/app-configuration?topic=app-configuration-ac-properties).
